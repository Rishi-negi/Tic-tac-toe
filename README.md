CONCLUSION
4.1 CONCLUSION
After giving some time to this mini-project I have concluded that this game can be beneficial for the development of brain functioning and multitasking for children:- 

•	It helps children apply their logic and develop a strategy at an early age.
•	It prepares children for more complex games because they have to think of multiple things at one time.
•	Tic-tac-toe helps develop coordination, fine motor skills, and visual skills.
•	It can help improve your child’s concentration.


4.2 FUTURE SCOPE
After working and  analyzing for some time on this mini-project( Tic Tac Toe )  though Tic Tac Toe is a fun loving mini and  popular among kids game but it still needs some modifications and update to make it in such a way that even youngters love it    
Some of them suggestions I have mentioned below:-

1.	Player limitation 
A 3X3 tic tac toe can only be played by 2 players, it needs to be made in such a way that a wide even number of players can play it at the same time with competing with each other.
2.	Another suggestion is bringing to front a variety of new rules 
And points system for every combination of marks in Tic Tac Toe so that the players can enjoy the game even more
